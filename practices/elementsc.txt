This is an object with one data property, city, and one method, greet(). If you type the object's name followed by a period into the console, like myObject., then the console will pop up a list of all the properties available to this object. You'll see that as well as city and greet, there are lots of other properties!

Own properties
The objects we create using the Person constructor above have two properties:

-a name property, which is set in the constructor, so it appears directly on Person objects
-a greet() method, which is set in the prototype.
